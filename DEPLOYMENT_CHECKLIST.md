## üìã What You Need to Do Next

### 1. **Set Up Google Cloud** (15 minutes)
1. Create Google Cloud project
2. Enable billing
3. Enable required APIs:
   - Cloud Run API
   - Cloud Build API
   - Container Registry API

### 2. **Connect GitHub Repository** (10 minutes)
1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already done)
2. Connect repository to Cloud Build
3. Create build trigger for `main` branch

### 3. **Deploy** (5 minutes)
1. Push to main branch
2. Watch automatic deployment in Cloud Build console
3. Get your live URL from Cloud Run

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy Commands

```bash
# If you haven't pushed to GitHub yet:
git add .
git commit -m "Add Google Cloud deployment configuration"
git push origin main

# The deployment will happen automatically via Cloud Build!
```

## üìä Your Application Features

- **PDF Upload & Viewing**: Users can upload and view PDF study materials
- **Interactive MCQ Tests**: Multiple choice questions with scoring
- **Document Processing**: DOCX file upload with question extraction
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for performance and security

## üîß Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run (containerized)
- **CI/CD**: Google Cloud Build
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem (recommend upgrading to Cloud Storage)

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations Applied

- Standalone Next.js build for smaller Docker images
- Multi-stage Docker build for efficiency
- Proper caching layers
- Security headers configured
- Compression enabled

## üîê Security Features

- File type validation for uploads
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Environment variable protection
- Docker user permissions

## üí° Recommended Next Steps (After Deployment)

1. **Add Database**: Use Cloud SQL or Firestore for persistent data
2. **Upgrade File Storage**: Use Cloud Storage instead of local filesystem
3. **Add Authentication**: Implement user login/signup
4. **Add Monitoring**: Set up error tracking and performance monitoring
5. **Custom Domain**: Configure your own domain name

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check the `DEPLOYMENT.md` file for detailed instructions
2. Review Cloud Build logs in Google Cloud Console
3. Check Cloud Run service logs
4. Verify all APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project

**Your application is production-ready and optimized for Google Cloud! üéâ**
